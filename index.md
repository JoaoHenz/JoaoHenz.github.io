I also have a lot of experience with machine learning and procedural content generation. My Computer Science conclusion work was in the area of Procedural Terrain Generation via Machine Learning.
I love working with a team, coordinating our efforts and dealing with difficult programming challenges. I aspire to one day lead a game dev team.

# Current Projects:
I am currently working with two companies from Porto Alegre. Both are small teams and work at distance:

## Software Developer at MegaDev: 
### October, 2019 -> Present
In MegaDev I work with a team of 4 developers at a distance. This project involves the complete development of a MMORPG inspired by a classic of the genre using the Unity Engine. I am responsible for almost all client related systems and we are in late stages of development, joining front and backend of the project.

## Software Developer at WorldRag / NewRO:
### December, 2019 -> Present
I work with a team of 3 developers working at a distance in the WorldRag and Newro servers. I am responsible mainly for content creation - new dungeons, cities, instances and events. All of this is done using python, SQL and [rAthena's script language](https://rathena.org/). I have also been responsible for the implementation of multiple online features for the server's website using PHP and HTML.
